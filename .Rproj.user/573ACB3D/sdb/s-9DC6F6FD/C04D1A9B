AirSage Data Samples\n#### 1.1 Airsage Data File Description\nThis is airsage data review. The following is the description of the data files\n\n1) **trip_leg_matrix_cusWDH.csv**  and **trip_leg_matrix_cusWDDP.csv**: reporting  trips between study area zones for average weekday 24 hour period and specific AM and PM day parts respectively.\n\n2) **trip_leg_submatrix_cusWDH.csv**  and **trip_leg_submatrix_cusWDDP.csv**: reporting trips between study area zones that passed through the sub matrix analysis zone (in the SZCount column) for average weekday 24 hour period and specific AM and PM day parts respectively. \n\nThe following are the list of files received from Airsage along with:\n1) number of samples\n2) number of trips\n3) ratio of trips to samples\n4) percent of samples\n5) percent of trips\n\n```{r read data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n  csvFiles <- dir(paste(projDir,\"/airsage\",sep=\"\"), pattern = \".csv\")\n\n  for (c in 1:length(csvFiles)){\n    data <- read.csv(paste0(\"airsage/\",csvFiles[c]))\n    nrows <- nrow(data)\n    ntrips <- sum(data$Count)\n    samples <- cbind(csvFiles[c], nrows, ntrips)\n    ifelse (c ==1 , all_samples <- samples, all_samples <- rbind(all_samples, samples))\n    ifelse (c ==1 , count <- nrows, count <- count + nrows)\n    ifelse (c ==1 , trips <- ntrips, trips <- trips + ntrips)\n  }\n\n    all <- data.frame(all_samples, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n    all <- rbind(all, c(\"Total\",count, trips))\n    all <- all %>% mutate(trip_per_sample = 100 * as.numeric(ntrips) / as.numeric(nrows))\n    all <- all %>% mutate(pct_samples = 100 * as.numeric(nrows) / count)\n    all <- all %>% mutate(pct_trips = 100 * as.numeric(ntrips) / trips)\n    names(all) <- c(\"File\", \"Samples\", \"Trips\",\"Trips/Samples\" ,\"% Sample\", \"% Trips\")\n    print(kable(all,format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 0))\n  \n```\n\nPeak data flow shows a total observations of 9,666 whereas total daily flows are only 6,052.\nDoes this mean the daily samples are only for offpeak? \n46% of the daily flow are represented from 24% sample?\n\n\n#### 1.2 Contents of \"trip_leg_matrix_cusWDDP.csv\" and Contents of \"trip_leg_matrix_cusWDDP.csv\"\nThis file contains 9,666 observations and 9 fields. Each sample was geocoded with an _Origin_Zone_ and _Destination_Zone_ pairs and _Count_ represents the total flows between these OD pairs. The start and end dates define the data collection period, which is April, 2015. The other fields: _Subscriber_Class_, _Purpose_ and _Time_of_Day_ describe the trip attributes.\n\n```{r daily & peak trips, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n  data_wddp <- read.csv(\"airsage/trip_leg_matrix_cusWDDP.csv\")\n  data_wdh <- read.csv(\"airsage/trip_leg_matrix_cusWDH.csv\")\n  data_wddp$tod <- \"peak\"\n  data_wdh$tod <- \"24H\"\n  data <- rbind(data_wddp, data_wdh)\n  print(head(data))\n```\n\nTotal trips from both files are shown below. \n```{r total trips, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n    \n  # Total trips\n  total_trips <- data %>% group_by(tod) %>% summarize(sum = sum(Count))\n  kable(total_trips,format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 0)\n```\n\nThe daily file contains more aggregated data with periods combined and thus the number of samples are fewer compared to AM/PM files. However, the total number of trips reveal that daily includes AM/PM trips although this needs to be confirmed from Airsage. \n\n```{r trips by purpose, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n  # Break down by purpose and period\n  samples <- data %>% group_by(tod, Purpose, Time_of_Day) %>% tally\n  trips <- data %>% group_by(tod, Purpose, Time_of_Day) %>% summarize(sum = sum(Count))\n  kable(left_join(samples,trips, by = c(\"Purpose\" , \"Time_of_Day\", \"tod\")),\n        format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 0)\n  \n```\n\n## 2. Review of AirSage Data\n#### 2.1 Contents of Daily file (_trip_leg_matrix_cusWDH.csv_)\n#### Trips by purpose and resident type (Subscriber_Class)\n* There are a total of 7,457,084 OD flows in 24H. \n* About 83% of these trips (6.2 Million daily flows) are made by resident population and the remaining 17% of trip are made by the visitors. \n* Most of the visitor trip purpose was Non-home based (NHB) as expected, however there are few handful of trips that are coded as Home-based other (HBO) trips (0.03%). These trips can be recoded into NHB as it makes less sense to assume a \"home end\" for visitors.\n* Of 6.2 Million resident trips, 17% are Home-based work (HBW), 29% are NHB and 36% are HBO trips. The work share of trips is in acceptable range for HBW trips (typically ~20%).\n\n\n```{r daily trips, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\n  trips_by_type    <- data_wdh %>% group_by(Subscriber_Class) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% arrange(Subscriber_Class)\n  trips_by_purpose <- data_wdh %>% group_by(Subscriber_Class, Purpose) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% arrange(Subscriber_Class)\n  trips_by_OD      <- data_wdh %>% group_by(Origin_Zone, Destination_Zone) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% spread(Destination_Zone, trips)\n\n  # Total trips  \n  sum <- trips_by_type %>% summarise(total = sum(trips))\n  print(paste(\"Total trips = \", as.character(sum), sep =\"\"))\n  \n  # Compute percentage\n  trips_by_type    <- trips_by_type %>%  mutate(percent = 100 * trips/sum$total)\n  trips_by_purpose <- trips_by_purpose %>% mutate(percent = 100 * trips/sum(sum$total))\n  \n  # Print summary\n  kable(trips_by_type,format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 0)\n  kable(trips_by_purpose,format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 0)\n  \n  # District to district flows (limit this to Flagler districts)\n  trips_by_OD <- trips_by_OD[,2:41]\n  trips_by_OD[is.na(trips_by_OD)] <- 0\n  \n  # Write output\n  write.csv(trips_by_OD, daily_od_matrix, row.names = FALSE)\n  \n```\n\n#### 2.2 Contents of Peak period files (_trip_leg_matrix_cusWDDP.csv_)\n#### Trips by purpose, resident type (Subscriber_Class) and time of day\n* There are a total of 2,945,178 OD flows in the peak two periods. \n* About 85% of these trips (2.5 Million flows) are made by resident population and the remaining 15% of trip are made by the visitors. \n* Most of the visitor trip purpose was Non-home based (NHB) as expected, however there are few handful of trips that are coded as Home-based other (HBO) trips (0.02%). These trips can be recoded into NHB as it makes less sense to assume a \"home end\" for visitors.\n* Of 2.5 Million resident trips, 21% are Home-based work (HBW), 29% are NHB and 34% are HBO trips. The non-work share of trips seems too high given this file contains data only for the 6 hour peak periods.\n* Trips by time of day shows almost equal split between AM and PM peak periods with slightly more trips in PM period.\n\n```{r peak trips, echo=FALSE}\n  trips_by_type    <- data_wddp %>% group_by(Subscriber_Class) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% arrange(Subscriber_Class)\n\n  trips_by_purpose <- data_wddp %>% group_by(Subscriber_Class, Purpose) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% arrange(Subscriber_Class)\n  \n  trips_by_period  <- data_wddp %>% group_by(Time_of_Day) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% arrange(Time_of_Day)\n  \n  trips_by_OD      <- data_wddp %>% group_by(Origin_Zone, Destination_Zone) %>% \n                      summarise(trips = sum(Count)) %>% spread(Destination_Zone, trips)\n\n  #

AirSage OD Flows\n#### Study Area Flows\nDistricts 20 - 40 represent Flagler Corridor study area.  The entire study area was defined as one super district \"StudyArea\" and the rest of the districts as \"Outside\" super district. The OD matrix generated for this super districts list the External-External (EE), Internal_External (IE), External_Internal (EI) and Internal-Internal (II) trips to the study area. The study area serves about 11% of the daily trips in the Miami-Dade county (sum of IE, EI and II trips). \n\n#### 3.1 Daily Study Area Flows\nTables below show the daily OD flows. In order to better understand the travel patterns through the corridor, OD tables are developed to & from the studyarea super district to all other districts, where district 20 is the aggregated study area district.\n\n\n```{r study_area_daily, echo=FALSE}\n  \n  # 1.

The tract to tract level data was obtained from ACS website and was processed to report out trips by mode and by districts (as defined in the above airsage data section). Also note that JTW is only for work purpose and is in person trip format which doesn't represent the entire regional trips.\n\nThe first table shows ACS CTPP trips by mode. There are about a million work related trips which are almost close to daily HBW trips reported in the airsage data. The breakup shows about 56,000 work related transit trips. The other category includes work from home, non-motorized modes.\n\n\n```{r CTPP data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Census ACS and CTPP data files\nctpp_flowFile <- \"acs_data/MiamiDade_CTPP_A302103.csv\"\nacs_shapeFile     <- \"acs_data/Tract_2014_Pop_Emp.shp\"\nacs_airsage_dist <- \"acs_data/tract_district_eqiv.csv\"\n\n# Read airsage districts\nacs_airsage <- read_csv(acs_airsage_dist)\nacs_airsage <- acs_airsage %>% select(NAME, district_e) %>%\n               mutate(\"tract\" = as.character(NAME))\n\n# Read ctpp flow data\nctpp_flows <- read_csv(ctpp_flowFile, skip = 2)\ncolnames(ctpp_flows) <- gsub(\" \", \"\", colnames(ctpp_flows)) \n\n# Clean data\nctpp_flows <- ctpp_flows %>% \n              separate(RESIDENCE, c(\"geoTypeRes\",\"countyRes\"), sep = \",\", extra = \"drop\", remove = TRUE) %>%\n              separate(geoTypeRes, c(\"geo1\",\"geo2\", \"tractRes\"), sep = \" \", remove = TRUE) %>%\n              separate(WORKPLACE, c(\"geoTypeWrk\",\"countyWrk\"), sep = \",\", extra = \"drop\", remove = TRUE) %>%\n              separate(geoTypeWrk, c(\"geo3\",\"geo4\", \"tractWrk\"), sep = \" \", remove = TRUE) %>%            \n              select(-geo1, -geo2, -geo3, -geo4, -X6) %>%\n              filter(countyRes != \" Broward County\", Output == \"Estimate\")\n\n# Recode modes              \ntransit_modes <- c(\"Bus or trolley bus\", \"Subway or elevated\", \n                   \"Streetcar or trolley car\", \"Railroad\") \n\nauto_modes <-   c(\"Car, truck, or van -- Drove alone\",\n                   \"Car, truck, or van -- In a 2-person carpool\",\n                   \"Car, truck, or van -- In a 3-person carpool\",\n                   \"Car, truck, or van -- In a 4-person carpool\",\n                   \"Car, truck, or van -- In a 5-or-6-person carpool\",\n                   \"Car, truck, or van -- In a 7-or-more-person carpool\",\n                   \"Taxicab\")\n\nall_modes  <-   \"Total, means of transportation\"\n \nctpp_flows   <- ctpp_flows %>% \n                mutate (modes = ifelse (MeansofTransportation18 %in% transit_modes, \"transit\",\n                                   ifelse (MeansofTransportation18 %in% auto_modes, \"auto\",\n                                      ifelse (MeansofTransportation18 == all_modes, \"total\",\n                                        \"other\"\n                                         )\n                                      )\n                                   )\n                       ) %>%\n                rename(Trips = Workers16andOver)\n\n# Append district to ctpp flows (recode Miami-Beach tracts to district 10)\nctpp_flows <- ctpp_flows %>% \n              left_join(acs_airsage, by = c(\"tractRes\" = \"tract\")) %>% \n              rename(From = district_e) %>% \n              select(-NAME) %>%\n              left_join(acs_airsage, by = c(\"tractWrk\" = \"tract\")) %>% \n              rename(To = district_e) %>%\n              select(-NAME) %>%\n              mutate(from = ifelse(is.na(From), 10, From),\n                      to = ifelse(is.na(To), 10, To))\n\n# Summarize data \nsamples <-  ctpp_flows %>% group_by(MeansofTransportation18, modes) %>% tally()\ntrips   <-  ctpp_flows %>% group_by(MeansofTransportation18, modes) %>% summarize(trips = sum(Trips)) \n\ntrips_by_mode <- ctpp_flows %>% \n                 group_by(modes) %>%\n                 summarise(trips = sum(Trips)) %>%\n                 arrange(trips)\n\ntrips_by_OD <- ctpp_flows %>% \n               filter(modes == \"transit\") %>% \n               group_by(From, To) %>% \n               summarise(transit = sum(Trips)) %>% \n               spread(To, transit)\n\ntrips_by_OD[is.na(trips_by_OD)] <- 0\n  \n# Print summaries            \nkable(left_join(samples,trips, by = c(\"MeansofTransportation18\", \"modes\")), \n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 2)\n            \nkable(trips_by_mode,format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"), digits = 2)\nwrite.csv(trips_by_OD, jtw_trn_matrix, row.names = FALSE)\n\n\n\n# #
